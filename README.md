This code performs essential preprocessing on the Titanic dataset. It begins by loading and exploring the data, identifying missing values and data types. Missing numerical values are filled using the mean, and categorical ones using the mode. Categorical columns are then converted to numerical using label encoding. Next, numerical features are standardized for uniform scaling. Outliers are visualized using boxplots, and then removed using the IQR method to clean the data. This preprocessing ensures the dataset is well-prepared for machine learning or statistical analysis.
